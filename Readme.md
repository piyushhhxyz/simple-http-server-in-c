# Simple HTTP Server in C

This is a basic implementation of an HTTP server in C. The server listens on a specified port (in this case, 8080) and responds with a simple HTTP/1.1 200 OK response along with a "Hello, Darkness My Old Friend ~ zeta-meow-meow!" message.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system. This code uses standard C libraries and should work on most systems.

## How to Run

1. Compile the server:

   ```bash
   gcc server.c -o server

Run the server:
   ./server
    ```
